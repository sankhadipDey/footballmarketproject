The Football Market Data ETL project on GCP utilizes the power of Google Cloud's Dataproc, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to extract, transform, and load diverse football market data. The project aims to collect real-time information on player transfers, club financials, match statistics, and other relevant data from various sources, and transform it into a unified format for analysis and reporting.
Data Extraction: Implement a scalable and efficient data extraction process to gather football market data from different sources such as transfer market websites. And kept that data in csv format in my local
Data Transformation: Apply data cleaning, validation, and normalization techniques using Dataproc's distributed processing capabilities. Convert raw data into a standardized format suitable for analysis and reporting.
Data Loading: Load the transformed data into BigQuery, Google Cloud's fully-managed data warehouse, for easy storage, retrieval, and analysis.
Data Integration: Establish relationships and mappings between different data sets within BigQuery to create a comprehensive view of the football market ecosystem. Integrate player profiles, transfer details, club financials, and match statistics for in-depth analysis.
Automation: Develop automated workflows using Dataproc and scheduling mechanisms to ensure regular data updates and minimize manual effort in the extraction and transformation processes.
Data Security and Privacy: Implement appropriate security measures within GCP, including access controls, encryption, and anonymization techniques, to protect sensitive data and comply with privacy regulations.
